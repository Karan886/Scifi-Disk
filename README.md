sci-fi Disk - Android Mobile Game

- Sci-fi disk is a single player platform based game, where user touches the screen to keep the disk in the game.
- Everytime the user keeps the disk floating, it costs the disk some fuel/energy.
- The user loses control of the disk when fuel/energy meter has completely depleted (and loses the game)
- There are 2 ways to regain fuel/energy: 
    1. watch out for health boxes on small bricked platforms and collect them
    2. bounce on rooftop platforms 3 times in 3 seconds to refuel
- Note that option 2 may sound more challenging but there are not nearly as enough health boxes to refuel as there are
  roof top platforms
- if you make a head collision (bouncing is fine) with any platform, you will lose

notes:
  - Still need to iterate the game a few more times before releasing to playstore.
  - A small alpha test revealed that the screen could feel empty at times, need more intriguing visuals (art work)
  - Want to avoid traditional coin collection, but it may just solve the empty screen issue
  - Need to Add distance disk has travelled and have a highscore system to keep users motivated and competitive
  
  
 Motivation: Flappy Bird is not the only platform based game worth building, there are other ideas out there
 waiting to be discovered. This project explores one of those ideas in hopes that it can become something unique.
 I was hoping to combine elements of platformers and other genres (ie. grid games) into this game but the bounce
 mechanics already absorbs alot of user focus. (not sure if adding more game mechanics would improve the gaming experience)
