<h1>Sci-fi Disk: Android Game</h1> 
<ul>
<li>Sci-fi disk is a <b><em>single player</em> platform based game</b> built for Android.</li>
<li>The <b>objective</b> of the game is to keep the disk floating by <em>tapping</em> on the screen.</li>
<li>When the player taps the screen, the disk uses fuel(energy) to float.</li>
<li>The game is <em>lost</em> when the <b>fuel/energy</b> meter is depleted or the disk <em>collides</em> to any platform.</li> 
<li><em>Bouncing</em> on a <b>platform</b> is allowed.</li>
<li>There are 2 options to regain <em><b>fuel/energy:</b></em></li> 
<ol>
<li>collecting health boxes that appear on the bricked platforms.</li>
<li>bouncing on rooftop platforms <em><b>3 times</b></em> in <em><b>3 seconds.</b></em></li>
</ol>
<li>Option 2 is preferred because there are more rooftop platforms than health boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <em>alpha test</em> reveals that the game interface is sometimes <em>bland</em> - More visuals and <b>artworks</b> need to be introduced.</li>
<li>
A traditional coin collection mechanism can serve as a solution to the the <em>bland</em> game interface. However, This component is considered as a last resort - just because it is very <em>common</em> in other games.
</li>
<li>The game needs to add a distance counter and a score system to keep users <b>motivated</b> and <b>interested</b> in the game.</li> 
</ul>
