Sci-fi Disk 

- Sci-fi disk is a single player platform based game built for Android.
- The objective of the game is to keep the disk floating by tapping on the screen.
- Each time the player taps the screen, the disk uses fuel(energy) to float.
- The game is lost when the fuel/energy meter is depleted.
- There are 2 ways to regain fuel/energy: 
    1. collecting health boxes that appear on the bricked platforms
    2. bouncing on rooftop platforms 3 times in 3 seconds. 
- Option 2 is the preferred way of refuelling because there are more rooftop platforms as there are health boxes.
- If the disk collides head on with any platform, the player loses the game. Bouncing on a platform is allowed.

Notes:
  - Game needs to undergo some iterative development before it can be released to the Play Store.
  - An alpha test revealed that the screen feels empty some times - the game could do with more visuals and art work.
  - The empty screen feedback could be improved by adding a traditional coin collection mechanism, but only as a last resort.
  - Need to add a distance counter and a score system to keep users motivated and interested in the game.  
  
 Motivation: The Flappy Bird game style is the most common in platform based games, but there are other many other game styles that have not yet been developed. This project explores one of them to create a unique game.
 I hoped to combine elements of platformers and other genres (eg. grid games), but the bounce
 mechanics already absorb user focus. Adding more game mechanics may not necessarily improve the experience.
