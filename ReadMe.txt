ReadMe:

This is an android application which works with user touch. 
The disk is controlled with user touch preventing it to fall off the screen. 

Rules:

A screen touch pushes the disk upwards and some health [be specific] is lost. To regenreate health, user can either collect a medicine package or
bounce on building platforms three times in given time. If the disk hits the front of the building opposed to top, user looses. 

Plans:

More features like coin collection and score system are to come.
